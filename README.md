# fastly-react-compute-edge

react framework tailor made for fastlys compute@edge serverless platform

## Introduction

## Running the development environment

The development environment uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) in middleware mode to mimic the SSR compute@edge environment without
sacrificing the developer productivity benefits vite provides.

To start the server:

```makefile
make -j dev
```

This command installs npm modules, and starts Vite.
